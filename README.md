### Overview
The project contains a data warehouse implementation to analyze tennis players' performances. Moreover, an ETL data flow process performed with SSIS is built to query the structure. Finally, we built an OLAP cube with SSAS and made business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) queries.

### Course Objectives
The course presents techniques for Business Analytics according to the data-driven
view of Data Science and Business Intelligence. It presents technologies and systems
for data access, for building and analyzing data warehouses, for reporting, and for
knowledge discovery in databases. The accent of the module is on the use of tools
and on the analysis of application problems by means of non-trivial samples and case
studies. The student will be aware and able to manage the main technologies of
Data Science and Business Intelligence, specifically software products for effective
decision support.
